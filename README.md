Machine Learning Examples in Python
===================================

I used popular python libraries for Machine Learning for data analysis
- Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, Keras, Tensorflow


Predicting users click-through rate on ads (based on Gender, Age, Estimated Salary) using Classification algorithms:
	- Logisitic Regression
	- KNN
	- SVM and Kernel SVM
	- Naive Bayes
	- Decisison Trees
	- Random Forest

Prediciting customer spending in a mall (based on Gender, Age, Annual income) using Clustering algorithms:
	- K-Means
	- Hierarchical Clustering
