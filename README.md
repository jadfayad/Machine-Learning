Simple Machine Learning Examples in Python
===================================

I used popular python libraries for Machine Learning for data analysis
- Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, Keras, Tensorflow


Predicting users click-through rate on ads (based on Gender, Age, Estimated Salary) using many CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS:
- Logisitic Regression
- KNN
- SVM and Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decisison Trees
- Random Forest

Identifying customer groups in a mall (based on Gender, Age, Annual income, Spending score) using CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS:
- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering

Optimizing click through rates on ads by identifying the best ad using REINFORCEMENT LEARNING algorithms:
- Upper Confidence Bound
- Thompson Sampling

Predicting if bank clients will leave the bank (based on credit score, geography, age, tenure, account balance, activity,..) using ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (tensorflow & keras):
- ANN with 2 hidden layers 

Predicting user reviews in a restuarant as good (1) or bad (2) (based on written reviews) using NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING:
- NLP with NLTK library & corpus

Learning association between grocery products based on the list of purchases of many clients:
- Apriori learning using the 'apyori.py' python class
