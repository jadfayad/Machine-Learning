Machine Learning Examples in Python
===================================

I used popular python libraries for Machine Learning for data analysis
- Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, Keras, Tensorflow


Predicting users click-through rate on ads (based on Gender, Age, Estimated Salary) using Classification algorithms
- Logisitic Regression
- KNN
- SVM and Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decisison Trees
- Random Forest

Identifying customer groups in a mall (based on Gender, Age, Annual income, Spending score) using Clustering algorithms:
- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering

Optimizing click through rates on ads by identifying the best ad using Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
- Upper Confidence Bound
- Thompson Sampling

Predicting if bank clients will leave the bank (based on credit score, geography, age, tenure, account balance, activity,..) using ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (tensorflow & keras):
- ANN with 2 hidden layers
